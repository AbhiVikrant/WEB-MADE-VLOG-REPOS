      This is not an easy concept. A computer is a machine built of millions of tiny switches called
      transistors, which have the property that they can be wired together in such a way that an
      output from one switch can turn another switch on or off. As a computer computes, these
      switches turn each other on or off in a pattern determined both by the way they are wired
      together and by the program that the computer is executing.
      Machine language instructions are expressed as binary numbers. A binary number is made
      up of just two possible digits, zero and one. So, a machine language instruction is just a sequence
      of zeros and ones. Each particular sequence encodes some particular instruction. The data that
      the computer manipulates is also encoded as binary numbers. A computer can work directly
      with binary numbers because switches can readily represent such numbers: Turn the switch on
      to represent a one; turn it off to represent a zero. Machine language instructions are stored
      in memory as patterns of switches turned on or off. When a machine language instruction
      is loaded into the CPU, all that happens is that certain switches are turned on or off in the
      pattern that encodes that particular instruction. The CPU is built to respond to this pattern
      by executing the instruction it encodes; it does this simply because of the way all the other
      switches in the CPU are wired together.
      So, you should understand this much about how computers work: Main me
